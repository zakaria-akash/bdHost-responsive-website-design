This project is a comprehensive approach to design a fully responsive website using only HTML and CSS â€“ no framework. Basic to mid-level CSS concepts are implemented here to achieve the responsive design pattern. This project is still in progress, some more advanced CSS concepts like grid, flexbox, transitions & animations will be applied soon.
